### Goal

Titrate lot1 of vNL\_sNLuc\_6ATRi.B.Bal.ecto based on the kinetics of RA and KW's virus; "Bal26 lot1", at the concentration that they use for infection experiments (1.92E6 pfu/ml)

Titration 001
-------------

This is a plot of luciferase production over days 1 - 14 for multiple conditions. The "Hladik Bal lot1" virus is vNL\_sNLuc\_6ATRi.B.Bal.ecto made by Greg Mize.

-   Day 1 supernatent still contains input virus. 1 wash is still day 1 but after the explants have been washed to remove input virus.

-   Hladik Bal26 lot1 with pfu/ml of 3.64E5 or 7.27E5 (dil. factors 68.76, 34.38) look closest to RA/KW's virus.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a plot of the luciferase over time from day1- 21 but we included fewer conditions based on the results from the first run of d1-14 with all conditions.

-   Hladik Bal26 lot1 with a pfu/ml of 7.27E5 (dil. factor of 34.38) looks closest to Bal26 lot1.

Titration 002
-------------

Lucia set up a second titration experiment on 14June16.

-   Hladik Bal with a dilution factor of 5.4E5 (dil. factor 46.3) matches the kinetics of Bal26 lot1.

This is all data for all experiments

Conclusions
-----------

-   Based on three nanoluc assays from two different titrations, the dilution factors for Hladik Bal lot1 virus that resulted in kinetics that were closest to Bal26 lot1 were 3.64E5, 5.4E5, 7.27E5 (dilution factors of 68.76, 46.3, 34.38) .
