Explant infection experiments
================

Explant infection overview:

Explants are infected at 2E6 pfu/ml and then washed after 20-24hr. After washing, media is replaced with media containing 0.6ug/ml PHA. PHA-containing media is replaced with plain media after ~24hr.

Luciferase levels in collected supernatent are assesed with the Promega nano-glo kit.

Explant Infection 001:
======================

Pre-incubate virus (vNL\_sNLuc.6ATRi.B.Bal.ecto) with exosomes before adding to explants:

-   Concentrations: 1E5 and 1E4 exosomes per pfu

-   Exosomes used: SE and HE

We also included explant only and virus only controls.

Explant infection 002
=====================

-   Same conditions as 001

Explant Infection 003:
======================

-   Concentrations: 1E5 and 1E4 exosomes per pfu, 1:50 seminal sup.

-   Exosomes used: SE and HE

This was a two part experiment:

Pre-incubate virus (vNL\_sNLuc.6ATRi.B.Bal.ecto) with exosomes OR seminal sup before adding to explants:

-   Controls = explants only and explants with virus that was incubated alone at 37C for ~1hr (like the virus + exos)

Pre-incubate explants with exosomes OR seminal sup before virus is added.

-   Controls = explants only and explants infected with virus that was kept in the fridge for ~1hr.

PROTOCOL DEVIATIONS:

-   I forgot to remove the PHA-containing media on day 2, so it wasn't replaced with new media until day 3.

-   There were 4 explants in the "pre-incubate explants with 1E5 HE" condition.

*Reminder*: In the plot below,"virus only" means that the explants were infected with virus that had been incubating (with no exos) for 1hr at 37C.

Explant Infection 004:
======================

-   Concentrations: 1E5,1E4, 1E3 and 5E4 exosomes per pfu, 1:50 seminal sup.

-   Exosomes used: SE and HE

-   Only did virus (vNL\_sNLuc.6ATRi.B.Bal.ecto) and exosome/sup preincubation (no exos + explant preinc)

Explant Infection 005:
======================

-   Concentrations: 1E5,1E4, 1E3 and 5E4 exosomes per pfu, 1:50 seminal sup.

-   Exosomes used: SE and HE

-   Only did virus (vNL\_sNLuc.6ATRi.B.Bal.ecto) and exosome/sup preincubation (no exos + explant preinc)

PROTOCOL DEVIATIONS:

-   During virus wash off I skipped a well so conditions 8-11 were off by one on the spin plate. I abandoned those pellets since they got mixed up and started using a new set of wells for the washes for those conditions.

Explant Infection 006:
======================

-   Concentrations: 1E5,1E4, 1E3 and 5E4 exosomes per pfu, 1:50 seminal sup.

-   Exosomes used: SE and HE

-   Only did virus (vNL\_sNLuc.6ATRi.B.Bal.ecto) and exosome/sup preincubation (no exos + explant preinc)

-   Did 2 reps for each condition

PROTOCOL DEVIATIONS:

-   Did not collect sups for conditions 1, 5, 9, 2, 6 and 10 on day 10 (by mistake) but did replace media.

First check how the replicates look ![](explant_infection_experiment_analysis_files/figure-markdown_github/checking%20replicates-1.png)

Compilations of results from multiple experiments (not including 006) arranged in a variety of ways:
