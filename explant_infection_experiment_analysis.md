Explant infection experiments
================

Explant infection overview:

Explants are infected and then washed after 20-24hr. After washing, media is replaced with media containing 0.6ug/ml PHA. PHA-containing media is replaced with plain media after ~24hr.

Luciferase levels in collected supernatent are assesed with the Promega nano-glo kit.

Explant infection 001 had the following conditions:

Pre-incubate virus with exosomes before adding to explants:

-   Concentrations: 1E5 and 1E4 exosomes per pfu

-   Exosomes used: SE and HE

We also included explant only and virus only controls. The virus concentration was 2E6 pfu/ml

Explant infection 002 had the same conditions as 001

Infection 003 had the following conditions:

Pre-incubate virus with exosomes OR seminal sup before adding to explants:

-   Concentrations: 1E5 and 1E4 exosomes per pfu, 1:50 seminal sup.

-   Exosomes used: SE and HE

Pre-incubate explants with exosomes OR seminal sup OR alone before virus is added, same concentrations and exos as above.

We also included explant only and virus only controls. The virus concentration was 2E6 pfu/ml.

PROTOCOL DEVIATIONS:

-   I forgot to remove the PHA-containing media on day 2, so it wasn't replaced with new media until day 3.

-   There were 4 explants in the "pre-incubate with 1E5 HE" condition

"virus\_preinc" means that the virus alone was at 37C before adding to the explant

"virus\_exo\_ preinc" means that the virus + exos were at 37C before adding to the explant
